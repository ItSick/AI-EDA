EDA For "Telco-Customer-Churn" dataset
Why this dataset?
In the future I would like to use the dataset to try and make a prediction model about customers that are about to churn/leave

(dataset and the follow content taken from kaggle)

Each row represents a customer
Each column contains customer's attibutes discribed below
The data set includes information about:
Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn

Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies

Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
